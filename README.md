# AKS-ArgoCD-ArgoRollouts-POC

Overview

This project is a proof-of-concept (POC) demonstration focusing on the integration and utilization of Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Argo CD, and Argo Rollouts. It provides a hands-on approach to setting up a Kubernetes environment, deploying applications with continuous deployment strategies, and implementing progressive delivery methods.
Objectives

Install and Connect to AKS: Guide users through installing Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and connecting to its console, setting the stage for further deployments.
Deploy Applications with Argo CD: Showcase the process of installing Argo CD on AKS and deploying applications, highlighting the benefits of GitOps methodologies.
Demonstrate Progressive Delivery with Argo Rollouts: Implement Argo Rollouts to demonstrate a progressive delivery method, such as canary releases or blue/green deployments, showcasing advanced deployment strategies in Kubernetes.

Key Features

Comprehensive Setup Guide: Step-by-step instructions for setting up AKS and establishing a connection to the Kubernetes console.
Argo CD Deployment and Usage: Detailed walkthrough on installing Argo CD, setting up a repository, and deploying a sample application.
Progressive Delivery Demonstration: Instructions and examples for using Argo Rollouts to execute progressive delivery strategies in a controlled and monitored environment.
